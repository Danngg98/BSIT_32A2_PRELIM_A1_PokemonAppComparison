All together, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code form a basic Pokémon search application. The HTML lays out the page, with a form where users input a Pokémon's name and an area to show the results. CSS adds visual interest by styling the page with simple fonts, active buttons, and a subtle background color. JavaScript manages interactivity by getting information from the Pokémon API when the form is submitted. If the input Pokémon is present, information like its name, picture, height, weight, and type are shown; otherwise, an error message is shown.

In short, HTML gives the structure, CSS adds the design, and JavaScript adds dynamic functionality. This blend demonstrates how these technologies complement each other to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
